      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student passionate about technology, games and software development. I love making cool ideas come to life, whether it's through game development or building software tools that solve real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        At university, I've been working on a variety of projects that strengthened my skills and taught me how to collaborate, adapt, and think creatively. Whether it's a game, an app, or any other project, I enjoy the process of designing, building, and refining. I love challenging myself into creating something cool.      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always curious to learn more about things I find interesting. My goal is to keep growing as a developer and eventually create something meaningful and fun that people will love.      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with this page is to make something casual where I can share some projects I've worked on at university or in my free time, and also to inspire me to keep exploring new ideas.      </p>
